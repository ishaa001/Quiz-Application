Which of the following is an advantage of adjacency list representation over adjacency matrix representation of a graph?
A. In adjacency list representation, space is saved for sparse graphs.
B. DFS and BSF can be done in O(V + E) time for adjacency list representation. These operations take O(V^2) time in adjacency matrix representation. Here is V and E are number of vertices and edges respectively.
C. Adding a vertex in adjacency list representation is easier than adjacency matrix representation.
D. All of the above
