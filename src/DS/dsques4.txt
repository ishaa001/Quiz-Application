Let A be a square matrix of size n x n. Consider the following program. What is the expected output?
C = 100
for i = 1 to n do
    for j = 1 to n do
    {
        Temp = A[i][j] + C
        A[i][j] = A[j][i]
        A[j][i] = Temp - C
    } 
for i = 1 to n do
    for j = 1 to n do
        Output(A[i][j]);

A. The matrix A itself
B. Transpose of matrix A
C. Adding 100 to the upper diagonal elements and subtracting 100 from diagonal elements of A
D. None of the above
