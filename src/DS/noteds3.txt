Binary Tree

The Binary tree means that the node can have maximum two children. Here, binary name itself suggests that 'two'; therefore, each node can have either 0, 1 or 2 children.

Properties of Binary Tree
At each level of i, the maximum number of nodes is 2i.
The height of the tree is defined as the longest path from the root node to the leaf node. The tree which is shown above has a height equal to 3. Therefore, the maximum number of nodes at height 3 is equal to (1+2+4+8) = 15. In general, the maximum number of nodes possible at height h is (20 + 21 + 22+â€¦.2h) = 2h+1 -1.
The minimum number of nodes possible at height h is equal to h+1.
If the number of nodes is minimum, then the height of the tree would be maximum. Conversely, if the number of nodes is maximum, then the height of the tree would be minimum.
If there are 'n' number of nodes in the binary tree.

The minimum height can be computed as:

As we know that,

n = 2h+1 -1

n+1 = 2h+1

Taking log on both the sides,

log2(n+1) = log2(2h+1)

log2(n+1) = h+1

h = log2(n+1) - 1

The maximum height can be computed as:

As we know that,

n = h+1

h= n-1

Types of Binary Tree
There are four types of Binary tree:

Full/ proper/ strict Binary tree
Complete Binary tree
Perfect Binary tree
Degenerate Binary tree
Balanced Binary tree
