Tree Data Structure

We read the linear data structures like an array, linked list, stack and queue in which all the elements are arranged in a sequential manner. The different data structures are used for different kinds of data.

Some factors are considered for choosing the data structure:

What type of data needs to be stored?: It might be a possibility that a certain data structure can be the best fit for some kind of data.
Cost of operations: If we want to minimize the cost for the operations for the most frequently performed operations. For example, we have a simple list on which we have to perform the search operation; then, we can create an array in which elements are stored in sorted order to perform the binary search. The binary search works very fast for the simple list as it divides the search space into half.
Memory usage: Sometimes, we want a data structure that utilizes less memory.
A tree is also one of the data structures that represent hierarchical data.
