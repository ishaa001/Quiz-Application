The post-order traversal of a binary search tree is given by 2, 7, 6, 10, 9, 8, 15, 17, 20, 19, 16, 12. Then the pre-order traversal of this tree is:
A. 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20
B. 7, 6, 2, 10, 9, 8, 15, 16, 17, 20, 19, 12
C. 7, 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, 20, 17, 19, 15, 16, 12
D. 12, 8, 6, 2, 7, 9, 10, 16, 15, 19, 17, 20
