RIP Protocol

RIP stands for Routing Information Protocol. RIP is an intra-domain routing protocol used within an autonomous system. Here, intra-domain means routing the packets in a defined domain, for example, web browsing within an institutional area. To understand the RIP protocol, our main focus is to know the structure of the packet, how many fields it contains, and how these fields determine the routing table.

Before understanding the structure of the packet, we first look at the following points:

RIP is based on the distance vector-based strategy, so we consider the entire structure as a graph where nodes are the routers, and the links are the networks.
In a routing table, the first column is the destination, or we can say that it is a network address.
The cost metric is the number of hops to reach the destination. The number of hops available in a network would be the cost. The hop count is the number of networks required to reach the destination.
In RIP, infinity is defined as 16, which means that the RIP is useful for smaller networks or small autonomous systems. The maximum number of hops that RIP can contain is 15 hops, i.e., it should not have more than 15 hops as 16 is infinity.
The next column contains the address of the router to which the packet is to be sent to reach the destination.
